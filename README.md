# gaze
Scripts to preprocess gaze data recorded with tobii eyetracker and presentation neurobs. The scripts combine different data files and calculates gaze metrics (e.g., fixations, saccades, and their derivable parameters). The fixations_util.py file contains the most generalizable functions that could be applied to other datasets.
